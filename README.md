# Retr089s Lethal Company
Welcome to my Lethal Company modpack! It has a little bit of everything that I believe enhances the experiece. This modpack was created mostly to make my friend's downloading mod experience less painful :D (I've barely used github before)

# Changelog

## Version 2.2.0
- Added two mods: kuba6000-LC_Masked_Fix and F4ilS4fe-MaskTheDead
- Tweaks: Modified MaskTheDead config (50% chance)
## Version 2.1.0
- Added one mod: HomelessGinger-MaskedEnemyOverhaul
- Tweaks: Added adjusted Skinwalker config
## Version 2.0.0, the Rapture
Many mods have been removed either to declutter or to try to make it a smoother experience. Here are the following changes:
- Removed mods: BadGojoSuit, FemboysAndFirearms, LethalPosters, LethalPaintings, PeterGriffinSuit, FreddyBracken, PushCompany, and FNaFEndoCoilhead
- Tweaks: changing CleanerLogs to log level Warning, Everyone gets an EmployeeAssignment, and TooManyEmotes is now 'Q' since it seemed a bit far.
## I HIGHLY recommend you create a new profile and add this modpack to it. Thunderstore does not have a way to remove mods that have been removed from a dependency list. Thank you. Also thank you for all the downloads :D
